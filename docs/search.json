    "text": "3.2 What can Package Manager do?\nIn context of Dash, Package Manager can do the following:\n\nSearch and install packages from CRAN, PyPI, and Bioconductor and even from Github - will showcase each bellow\nMirror public repositories inside your own firewall, even offline\nAdd your own internal packages and binaries\nImprove security by blocking high-risk and unwanted packages\n\nThe list isn’t exhaustive for what Package Manager is able to achieve. For example curating subsets of CRAN and PyPI into custom repositories is something that can be done. Yet, we haven’t curated a list of libraries so that we allow users to download freely without any obstacles the desired libraries into their own environments. This is an advantage since a lot of libraries get updated.\nFurthermore, if there is a library the presents high-risk for Dash platform, this is flagged in Package Manager and cannot be downloaded into your own environment.",
