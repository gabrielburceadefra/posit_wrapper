## Welcome

The present book is to guide Dash users in how to make the best use of Posit Workbench, Connect and Package Manager. 
The resource is just a sample of the book and purposed only for certain users that are testing the Posit items. 
More importantly, this isn't a final sample, I have to change certain pictures to make it clearer for the user. 
Thus, please bear with me until I get everything sorted. 

Please do not make the resource available to anyone yet as this sections would be added to Dash Playbook. 

If any parts of the sections aren't clear, please do get in contact with me - Gabriel Burcea-Ting, via teams. :)
